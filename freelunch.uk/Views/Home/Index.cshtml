            The intention of meetfreelunch.uk is to facilitate a "brown bag lunch" which are an informal meeting that takes place over lunch.
            This type of meeting is called a brown bag meeting because participants normally provide their own lunches. But as you are inviting a specialist
            to come and speak at your meeting we think it is only fair for you to provide the speakers lunch.
            In the business world, a brown bag meeting would take place in the office, probably in the conference room.
            Brown bag meetings save companies money because they don't have to supply food or drink for the attendees.
            If a business wants to host a more formal meeting, it might do so at a classy restaurant and pay for every participant's food and drink.

            As a specialist you have the chance of sharing your knowledge of a subject you are passionate about.
